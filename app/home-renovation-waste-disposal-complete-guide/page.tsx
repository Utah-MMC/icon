            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Home renovation waste disposal planning is often an afterthought, but it's actually one of the most critical aspects 
              of a successful project. I've learned through years of managing renovations that poor waste planning can derail 
              your entire timeline and blow your budget.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              The average home renovation generates 2-5 tons of waste, and without proper planning, you'll find yourself 
              scrambling to find disposal solutions when you're already behind schedule.

              <p className="text-blue-800">
                Planning your waste disposal strategy before starting demolition can save you 25-40% on disposal costs 
                and prevent project delays due to waste management issues.

              Start by assessing your renovation scope and estimating the types and amounts of waste you'll generate. 
              Different materials require different disposal methods, and understanding this upfront will help you choose 
              the right waste management strategy.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Choosing the wrong dumpster size is one of the most expensive mistakes homeowners make during renovations. 
              Too small, and you're paying for multiple pickups. Too large, and you're wasting money on unused capacity.

              <p className="text-green-800">
                For most home renovations: 10-yard dumpsters handle small projects like bathroom remodels, 20-yard containers 
                work for medium projects like kitchen renovations, and 30-yard dumpsters are ideal for large projects or whole-house remodels.

              Home renovations offer excellent opportunities for recycling and reusing materials, which can significantly 
              reduce your disposal costs while being environmentally responsible. Many materials that seem like waste 
              can actually be valuable to others.

                On a recent kitchen renovation, we were able to recycle 70% of the waste materials, including cabinets, 
                appliances, and construction debris, saving over $800 in disposal costs.

              Renovation waste disposal costs can quickly add up, but with smart strategies, you can significantly

                Consider renting a dumpster for the entire project duration rather than scheduling multiple pickups. 
                Many companies offer weekly or monthly rates that are more cost-effective than daily rentals.
