            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Why Choosing the Right Dumpster Size Matters</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Before we started Icon Dumpsters, I'll never forget the first time we rented a dumpster for a shop cleanout. I thought, "Eh, a 10-yard should do it." Big mistake. Two days in, I was climbing a literal mountain of junk trying to make it all fit. Spoiler: it didn't. I ended up ordering a second dumpster, and guess what? That meant double the cost. Lesson learned.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The truth is, picking the right dumpster size isn't just about space—it's about money. If your dumpster's too small, you're gonna end up paying for multiple hauls. If it's too big, you've wasted money on space you don't even use. That's why nailing the size from the start matters more than most folks realize.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Another thing people don't think about? Overage fees. Dumpster rental companies have weight limits. Toss in a few couches, maybe some old drywall, and suddenly you're hundreds of pounds over. They don't just "let it slide." You'll get hit with charges per extra ton, and trust me, it adds up quick.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              On the flip side, getting the right size dumpster saves you time. No need for multiple pickups or frantic "Where do I put this?" moments when your dumpster is overflowing. One cleanout, one drop-off, one pickup. Done and dusted.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              And here's the part people often forget: local regulations. Some areas are strict about what goes in dumpsters and how much weight they'll allow on the road. If you overload, you're not just risking fees—you could be violating local laws. Nobody wants a fine because their 20-yard dumpster turned into a Mount Everest of junk.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              In short, choosing the right dumpster size matters because it saves you money, time, and frustration. Plus, it keeps you compliant with rules you probably didn't even know existed. If you're on the fence, my advice is this: when in doubt, go a little bigger. You'll thank yourself later.

              Here's where people get overwhelmed. "Do I need a 10-yard? A 30-yard? What even fits in these things?" I remember Googling dumpster sizes for the first time and feeling like I needed a degree in waste management just to order one. So let me break it down in plain English.
            </p>

            <div className="space-y-6 mb-8">
              <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">10-yard dumpster</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">Think small projects. A single-room cleanout, maybe some yard waste, or just clearing out the attic. It holds about 3 pickup truck loads. We once used one for an attic purge, and it was just right—until I found 15 boxes of old Christmas decorations I forgot about.</p>
              </div>

              <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">15-yard dumpster</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">Great for medium cleanouts. This size fits about 4–5 pickup loads. Perfect for cleaning out a garage that's packed to the brim with old bikes, tools, and boxes you haven't opened since the Clinton administration.</p>
              </div>

              <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">20-yard dumpster</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">This is the all-star. Most people go for this one because it works for bigger jobs like full-home cleanouts, kitchen remodels, or clearing out a basement. About 6 pickup loads worth of space. Personally, this one saved me during a basement flood cleanout—so much ruined carpet and furniture, and it all fit.</p>
              </div>

              <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">30-yard dumpster</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">Big projects, big dumpster. Holds around 9 pickup loads. Great for multi-room cleanouts, large renovations, or if you're tackling both the inside and outside of your house at once.</p>
              </div>

              <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">40-yard dumpster</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">The beast. This is the go-to for estate cleanouts or full-house demolitions. Holds about 12 pickup loads. I've never needed one this big personally, but my buddy rented one after tearing down his old deck and gutting the inside of his house. He filled it. Twice.</p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              The key takeaway? Each size has a sweet spot. Go smaller for light projects, mid-range for typical home cleanouts, and bigger if you're dealing with serious amounts of debris. And remember, a dumpster that's too small will cost more in the long run than going one size up.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">How to Estimate the Right Size for Your Project</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              So how do you actually figure out what dumpster size you need? This is the part that used to stress me out the most. I'd stand in my cluttered garage thinking, "Is this a 10-yard mess or a 30-yard disaster?"
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Here's the method I learned after messing it up once (or twice):
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>First, look at the type of junk.</strong> If you've got bulky furniture—couches, dressers, mattresses—those eat up space faster than you think. A garage packed with old furniture will fill a 20-yard dumpster quicker than a garage full of cardboard boxes. On the flip side, if it's construction debris like drywall or wood, you've got to consider weight limits as much as volume.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Next, think in cubic yards.</strong> Sounds fancy, but it's just a way of measuring space. A 10-yard dumpster holds about 3 pickup truck loads of junk. A 20-yard? Roughly 6 loads. When I did my first full home cleanout, I walked through each room and tried to picture how many pickup truck loads it would take. Multiply that by 3, and you'll have a decent ballpark.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Also, check out the dumpster rental company's size charts.</strong> They usually show what fits in each dumpster. One chart I used compared dumpster sizes to common projects, like "10-yard = small attic cleanout, 20-yard = basement cleanout, 30-yard = major renovation." It saved me from guessing blind.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              And here's my golden rule: <strong>always round up.</strong> You'll rarely regret having too much space, but you'll always regret not having enough. Nothing kills momentum like a half-cleaned garage and no room left to toss the junk. When in doubt, get a quote for the next size up.
            </p>

              Let's make this super practical. Here are some real-world examples that might help you visualize.

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Garage Cleanout</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">If your garage is like mine was—boxes stacked to the ceiling, old bikes with flat tires, broken lawn chairs—you'll probably need a 10–15 yard dumpster. If you've got bigger furniture in there, bump it to a 20.</p>
              </div>

              <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Basement Cleanout</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">Basements are sneaky. You think you don't have much, then you start pulling out boxes of who-knows-what from 20 years ago. A 15–20 yard dumpster usually does the trick. I filled a 20-yarder during a flood cleanup with soaked carpet and furniture. It was tight, but it worked.</p>
              </div>

              <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">

                <p className="text-gray-700">Attics usually don't have giant furniture, so a 10–15 yard dumpster is plenty. Unless you're like me and discover 30 years of holiday decorations, broken toys, and boxes of outdated clothes you swore you'd donate someday.</p>
              </div>

              <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Full Home Cleanout</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">This is where the 20–30 yard dumpsters shine. When my aunt passed, we had to clear out her whole house. We rented a 30-yarder, and it was the only thing that kept us sane. Estate cleanouts are no joke.</p>
              </div>

                <p className="text-gray-700">Remodeling projects can go from "small mess" to "where did all this drywall come from?!" in a heartbeat. Kitchen remodels often fit in a 20-yard dumpster. Full home renovations? Go 30 or 40.</p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Mistakes to Avoid When Estimating Dumpster Size</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              If I had a dollar for every mistake I made renting dumpsters, I could probably pay for another dumpster. Here are the biggest blunders you'll want to dodge.
            </p>

            <div className="space-y-6 mb-8">
              <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-6 rounded-r-lg">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-red-900 mb-3">1. Underestimating your junk.</h3>
                <p className="text-red-800">Every. Single. Time. We always think we have less stuff than we actually do. My first "small" garage cleanout filled a 15-yarder to the brim. Don't fool yourself—junk multiplies when you start dragging it out.</p>
              </div>

              <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-6 rounded-r-lg">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-red-900 mb-3">2. Ignoring weight limits.</h3>
                <p className="text-red-800">This one stings. I once loaded a 20-yard dumpster with broken concrete. I thought, "Perfect size!" Nope. It hit the weight limit halfway full, and the company charged me hundreds in overage fees. Lesson: heavy items add up fast.</p>
              </div>

              <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-6 rounded-r-lg">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-red-900 mb-3">3. Going too small to "save money."</h3>
                <p className="text-red-800">I get it—you see the price difference between a 10-yard and 20-yard dumpster and think, "I'll save $75." Wrong. If you fill the 10 and need a second one, now you're paying double. Spend a little more upfront and save big in the long run.</p>
              </div>

              <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-6 rounded-r-lg">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-red-900 mb-3">4. Forgetting about placement.</h3>
                <p className="text-red-800">I once ordered a 30-yard dumpster for my driveway… only to realize my driveway was too short. The truck couldn't back it in properly, and I had to settle for a smaller one. Always check the placement space before renting.</p>

            <div className="mb-8">

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Let's talk money—because at the end of the day, that's what most of us care about. Dumpster rental costs depend heavily on size, but there's more to it than just the sticker price.
            </p>

            <div className="space-y-6 mb-8">
              <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Base price by size.</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">Typically, the bigger the dumpster, the higher the cost. A 10-yard might run you $250–$350, while a 30-yard could be $450–$600. Prices vary a lot by city, but that's the ballpark I've seen.</p>
              </div>

              <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Weight limits.</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">Every dumpster has a max weight. Go over, and you'll get hit with overage fees, usually $50–$100 per extra ton. One time, I underestimated how heavy my basement carpet was after flooding—it soaked up so much water that I went 1.5 tons over. Cost me almost $100 extra.</p>
              </div>

              <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Permits.</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">If your dumpster sits on the street instead of your driveway, some towns require a permit. I've paid $50 for one before, and I've also skipped it (not recommended). A neighbor complained, and I ended up with a warning letter.</p>
              </div>

              <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Extra fees.</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">Some items aren't "free" to dump. Mattresses, tires, appliances, even TVs often come with extra disposal charges. The first time I tossed a fridge in the dumpster, the company tacked on a $75 fee I wasn't expecting. Always ask what's allowed.</p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              The takeaway? Dumpster rental costs are more than just the base rate. Plan for weight, permits, and special items so you don't get surprised later. Get a detailed quote to see all potential costs upfront.

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">What size dumpster do I need for a garage cleanout?</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">Most garage cleanouts fit in a 10 to 15-yard dumpster. If you've got lots of bulky items like furniture or appliances, consider bumping up to a 20-yard.</p>
              </div>

              <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">How do I estimate the right dumpster size for a home cleanout?</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">Start by looking at the type and amount of debris. A good rule of thumb is that a 10-yard dumpster equals about 3 pickup truck loads. Walk through each room you're clearing and estimate the total loads, then match it to the right dumpster size.</p>
              </div>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">What happens if my dumpster is too small?</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">If your dumpster is too small, you'll either need to rent a second dumpster or pay extra for multiple hauls. This usually ends up costing more than just renting a slightly larger dumpster from the start.</p>
              </div>

              <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">What's the most popular dumpster size for home cleanouts?</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">The 20-yard dumpster is the most popular choice. It's large enough for most home cleanouts and renovation projects, but not so big that you're overpaying for unused space.</p>
              </div>

              <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">How much does it cost to rent a dumpster for a cleanout?</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">Dumpster rental prices vary by location, but generally range from $250 for a 10-yard to $600 for a 30-yard. Additional costs may apply for overweight loads, permits, or restricted items.</p>
              </div>

              <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Do I need a permit to rent a dumpster?</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">If the dumpster is placed on your driveway, usually no permit is required. If it sits on a public street or sidewalk, most cities require a permit. Fees can range from $25–$100 depending on your local regulations.</p>
              </div>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Estimating the right dumpster size for a home cleanout project doesn't have to feel overwhelming. Once you understand how dumpster sizes line up with different projects—and the costs tied to them—it all starts to make sense.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              If you take anything from my mistakes, it's this: don't underestimate your junk, always factor in weight, and when in doubt, go a little bigger. It's cheaper to pay for a bit of extra space than to scramble for a second dumpster halfway through.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
              So, whether you're clearing out the garage, tackling a flooded basement, or doing a full home cleanout, there's a perfect dumpster size out there for you. Pick wisely, plan ahead, and you'll save yourself money, time, and frustration.
