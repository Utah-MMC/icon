const comprehensiveFAQs = [
  {
    question: "What are the different dumpster rental sizes available in Utah?",
    answer: "In Utah, dumpster rental companies typically offer three main sizes: 15-yard dumpsters (16' x 7' x 4', holds 15 cubic yards), 20-yard dumpsters (16' x 7' x 6', holds 20 cubic yards), and 30-yard dumpsters (22' x 7' x 6', holds 30 cubic yards). The 15-yard is ideal for small home cleanouts, the 20-yard for medium renovations, and the 30-yard for large construction projects or major home renovations."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to rent a dumpster in Utah?",
    answer: "Dumpster rental costs in Utah typically range from $300-$600 depending on size and rental duration. A 15-yard dumpster averages $300-400, 20-yard dumpsters cost $350-450, and 30-yard dumpsters range $450-600. Prices include delivery and pickup, but landfill disposal is usually billed separately at $55/ton. Most companies offer 7-14 day rental periods with additional fees for extended rentals."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a permit to place a dumpster on the street in Utah?",
    answer: "Yes, in most Utah cities including Salt Lake City, you need a permit to place a dumpster on public streets or sidewalks. Permit costs typically range $25-75 and are valid for 7-14 days. You can apply through your city's public works department. However, if you place the dumpster on your private property (driveway, yard), no permit is required. Always check with your local city regulations as requirements vary by municipality."
  },
  {
    question: "What materials are prohibited in dumpster rentals?",
    answer: "Prohibited materials in Utah dumpster rentals include hazardous waste (paint, chemicals, batteries), electronics (TVs, computers), tires, medical waste, and asbestos. Most companies also prohibit liquids, food waste, and yard waste in standard dumpsters. Some materials like concrete, dirt, and roofing shingles may be allowed but often incur additional fees due to weight restrictions. Always confirm acceptable materials with your rental company before loading."
  },
  {
    question: "How long can I keep a dumpster rental?",
    answer: "Standard dumpster rental periods in Utah are typically 7-14 days, with most companies offering flexible terms. Extended rentals are usually available for an additional daily fee ($5-15 per day). Some companies offer monthly rates for long-term projects. The rental period starts when the dumpster is delivered, and you're responsible for scheduling pickup within your agreed timeframe to avoid additional charges."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between roll-off and front-load dumpsters?",
    answer: "Roll-off dumpsters are large, open-top containers (15-40 yards) delivered by specialized trucks that roll them off the truck bed. They're ideal for construction, renovation, and large cleanout projects. Front-load dumpsters are smaller (2-8 yards), permanently placed containers with hinged lids, serviced by trucks with front-loading mechanisms. Roll-offs are for temporary projects, while front-loads are for ongoing waste collection at businesses or apartment complexes."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I move a dumpster once it's placed?",
    answer: "No, you cannot move a dumpster once it's placed. Dumpsters are heavy (empty 15-yard dumpsters weigh 3,000-4,000 pounds) and moving them requires specialized equipment. If you need to relocate a dumpster, contact your rental company immediately. They may be able to move it for an additional fee, or you may need to wait for pickup and schedule a new delivery. Always choose your placement location carefully during delivery."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I exceed the weight limit on my dumpster?",
    answer: "Exceeding weight limits typically results in additional fees of $50-100 per ton over the limit. Most 15-yard dumpsters have a 2-3 ton limit, 20-yard dumpsters allow 3-4 tons, and 30-yard dumpsters permit 4-6 tons. Heavy materials like concrete, dirt, or roofing shingles can quickly exceed limits. Some companies offer 'heavy material' dumpsters with higher weight allowances for an additional fee. Always discuss your project materials with the rental company to avoid surprises."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I choose the right dumpster size for my project?",
    answer: "Choose dumpster size based on your project type and volume. For home cleanouts: 15-yard for 1-2 rooms, 20-yard for 3-4 rooms, 30-yard for whole house. For construction: 20-yard for small projects (bathroom/kitchen), 30-yard for large projects (whole house renovation). For yard work: 15-yard for moderate cleanup, 20-30-yard for major landscaping. When in doubt, size up rather than down to avoid overflow fees or needing a second dumpster."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the delivery and pickup requirements for dumpster rentals?",
    answer: "Delivery requires a flat, solid surface (concrete, asphalt, or compacted gravel) with at least 60 feet of overhead clearance and 22 feet of width for the delivery truck. The area must be accessible without crossing private property. For pickup, ensure the dumpster is accessible and not overloaded (materials should not extend above the dumpster walls). Most companies require 24-48 hours notice for pickup scheduling. Some areas may have specific access requirements, so confirm with your rental company."
