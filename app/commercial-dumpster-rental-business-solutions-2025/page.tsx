            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Commercial waste management is fundamentally different from residential projects. Businesses generate consistent, 
              predictable waste streams that require specialized solutions and ongoing management. After working with hundreds 
              of commercial clients, I've learned that understanding your waste profile is the first step to optimizing costs.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              Commercial operations can generate anywhere from 2-20 tons of waste monthly, depending on industry, size, 
              and operational intensity. This volume requires strategic planning and enterprise-level solutions.
            </p>

              <p className="text-blue-800">
                Commercial waste management can account for 3-8% of operational costs. Strategic optimization can reduce 
                these costs by 20-35% while improving sustainability metrics.

              Different industries have unique waste profiles: restaurants generate organic waste and packaging,

              Understanding these patterns is crucial for designing effective waste management solutions.
