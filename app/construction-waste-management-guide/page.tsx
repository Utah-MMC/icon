            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Construction waste management isn't just about getting rid of debris - it's about understanding what you're dealing with 
              and how to handle it responsibly. After 15 years in the industry, I've seen everything from perfectly reusable materials 
              being tossed to hazardous waste being improperly disposed of.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              The construction industry generates over 600 million tons of waste annually in the US alone. That's a staggering amount 
              that represents both a challenge and an opportunity for cost savings and environmental responsibility.
            </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-900 mb-3">Key Takeaway</h3>
              <p className="text-blue-800">
                Up to 90% of construction waste can be recycled or reused, potentially saving contractors 20-30% on disposal costs 
                while improving their environmental footprint.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Construction waste typically falls into several categories: inert materials like concrete and brick, recyclable materials 
              like metal and wood, and hazardous materials that require special handling. Understanding these categories is crucial 
              for effective waste management planning.

              Recycling construction waste isn't just good for the environment - it's good for your bottom line. I've saved thousands 
              of dollars on projects by implementing smart recycling strategies and working with waste management companies that 
              specialize in construction material recovery.

              <p className="text-green-800">
                On a recent commercial renovation project, we achieved 85% waste diversion through strategic sorting and 
                partnerships with local recycling facilities, saving over $15,000 in disposal costs.

                Many cities now require construction waste diversion rates of 50-75%. Failure to meet these requirements can result 
                in project delays and significant fines.

              Construction waste management costs can quickly spiral out of control if not managed properly. But with the right strategies,

                Negotiate bulk pricing with waste management companies for long-term projects. Many companies offer significant

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Construction waste management doesn't have to be a headache or a budget-buster. With proper planning, smart strategies, 
              and the right partnerships, you can turn waste management into a competitive advantage for your business.

              Remember, the goal isn't just compliance - it's optimization. Every dollar saved on waste disposal is a dollar 
              that goes straight to your bottom line, and every ton of waste diverted from landfills is a step toward a more 
              sustainable construction industry.
